# GeminiZ

![GeminiZ Logo](/docs/assets/GeminiZ.png)

> **🛡️ Your personal data, your rules, auditable by default.**

GeminiZ is a fork of [Gemini CLI](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli)
that adds a **privacy governance layer** for AI agents. It uses a declarative
file called `PIMS.md` — think `.gitignore` but for your personal data — to
control what PII each tool can access, with full audit trails.

![GeminiZ in action](/docs/assets/Global%20Screenshot.png)

## 🔒 The Problem

Everyone is using AI CLI tools — Claude Code, Gemini CLI, Cursor — sending
personal data to every tool, every skill, every MCP server. Most of these are
unverified. **40,000 exposed OpenClaw instances, 400 malicious plugins, 10,000
compromised developers** from supply chain attacks. Your PII is one bad skill
away from being exfiltrated.

Nobody has built the privacy layer for AI agents. **Until now.**

## 🛡️ How GeminiZ Works

1. **📋 PIMS.md** — A declarative policy file that defines what personal data
   exists, sensitivity levels, and which tools can access what
2. **🤖 Local PII Detection** — Uses open-source models like
   [AI4Privacy](https://huggingface.co/ai4privacy/llama-ai4privacy-multilingual-categorical-anonymiser-openpii)
   or Gemma, running locally — your data never leaves your machine
3. **✅🚫 Access Control** — Tools must declare what PII they need. No
   declaration, no data
4. **📝 Audit Trail** — Every access is logged. Not just to protect you — but to
   prove it to your clients, your team, your regulators

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Run the flight check-in demo
python3 examples/booking_flight/demo.py

# View the audit trail
python3 -m geminiz_core.audit_viewer

# Run the live PIMS auditor (side panel)
python3 -m geminiz_core.pims_auditor
```

### In Gemini CLI

```bash
npm run start
> Read my flight ticket at examples/booking_flight/flight_ticket.txt and check in for me
```

The **PII-Awareness** skill auto-activates, scans the file for personal data,
enforces PIMS.md rules, and logs everything.

## 📋 PIMS.md Example

```
airline-checkin | BOOKING_CODE, FLIGHT_NUMBER, SEAT_NUMBER, NAME, EMAIL | PASSPORT_NUMBER, CREDIT_CARD_NUMBER, ADDRESS
replit-deploy   | REPLIT_API_KEY | OPENAI_API_KEY, HF_TOKEN, GCP_API_KEY
```

Booking code? ✅ Fine. Passport number? 🚫 Blocked. Birth certificate? 🚫
Something's fishy.

  detection model

```bash
# Set your Google Cloud Project
export GOOGLE_CLOUD_PROJECT="YOUR_PROJECT_ID"
gemini
```

### Option 2: Gemini API Key

For Google Workspace accounts and other authentication methods, see the
[authentication guide](./docs/get-started/authentication.md).

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Basic Usage

#### Start in current directory

```bash
gemini
```

#### Include multiple directories

```bash
gemini --include-directories ../lib,../docs
```

#### Use specific model

```bash
gemini -m gemini-2.5-flash
```

#### Non-interactive mode for scripts

Get a simple text response:

```bash
gemini -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase"
```

For more advanced scripting, including how to parse JSON and handle errors, use
the `--output-format json` flag to get structured output:

```bash
gemini -p "Explain the architecture of this codebase" --output-format json
```

For real-time event streaming (useful for monitoring long-running operations),
use `--output-format stream-json` to get newline-delimited JSON events:

```bash
gemini -p "Run tests and deploy" --output-format stream-json
```

### Quick Examples

#### Start a new project

```bash
cd new-project/
gemini
> Write me a Discord bot that answers questions using a FAQ.md file I will provide
```

#### Analyze existing code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli
cd gemini-cli
gemini
> Give me a summary of all of the changes that went in yesterday
```
